# Overview
Via https://rpc-dataset.github.io:
* This dataset enjoys the following characteristics: (1) It is by far the largest dataset in terms of both product image quantity and product categories. (2) It includes single-product images taken in a controlled environment and multi-product images taken by the checkout system. (3) It provides different levels of annotations for the checkout images. Comparing with the existing datasets, ours is closer to the realistic setting and can derive a variety of research problems.

# Use Cases
This dataset could be used to create an automatic item counter or checkout system using computer vision with [Roboflow's API](https://docs.roboflow.com/inference/hosted-api), [Python Package](https://docs.roboflow.com/python), or other deployment options, such as Web Browser, iOS device, or to an Edge Device: https://docs.roboflow.com/inference/hosted-api.
